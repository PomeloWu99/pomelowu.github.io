## Modeling Projects

### Causal Inference
#### [Causal Relationship between Abolition of the Death Penalty and Violent Crime across 42 States](#link)
Investigated the causal impact of abolishing the death penalty on violent crime rates using econometric models across 42 U.S. states. This analysis helps understand the policy implications and effectiveness.

### Natural Language Processing
#### [Book Genre Prediction using LDA and Naive Bayes](https://github.com/pomeloywu/NLP)
Developed a model to predict the genre of books based on their descriptions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Naive Bayes classifiers. This project enhances automated cataloging and recommendation systems.

### Statistical Models and Machine Learning
#### [Survival Analysis](https://github.com/PomeloWu99/survival_analysis/tree/main))
Performed survival analysis to determine the factors that significantly impact patient outcomes in clinical trials. The study utilizes advanced regression techniques to improve treatment strategies.

#### [UAS Semantic Segmentation for Safe Landing](https://github.com/YZhu0225/UAS-Semantic-Segmentation-for-Safe-Landing) 
Implemented semantic segmentation on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to identify safe landing zones. The project uses machine learning algorithms to process real-time imagery and ensure landing safety.
